D. Easley, J. Kleinberg.
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/">
Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World.</a>
Cambridge University Press, 2010.

<li>
<i>
This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled
<a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2017fa/">
Networks</a>.
The book, like the
course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate
level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper
explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with
optional advanced sections.
